Scripts for extracting f0 and formants information from [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), and scripts are based on [praatscripts](https://github.com/lingdoc/praatscripts.git)


This repository contains several Praat scripts that automate various analyses for users. Descriptions of the scripts are contained within the scripts themselves, or in additional README files in folders where the scripts reside. Contributions/fixes/features are welcomed and encouraged.

Currently the repository contains the following scripts:

- [**time_f0_F1_F2_F3_intensity.praat**](https://github.com/kazzyabe/praatscripts/tree/master/Extract_formant_data)
  - A script that gets time, pitch, formant, and intensity values for every 0.01 secs in a TextGrid-segmented WAV file.

- [**analysis.py**](https://github.com/kazzyabe/praatscripts/tree/master/Extract_formant_data)
  - A script for plotting extracted data
